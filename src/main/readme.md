HI! This Sudoku game was implemented via JavaFX with help from a tutorial 
made by Ryan Michael Kay. I implemented changes afterward to fix some remaining bugs
/ make the game run smoother! I learned a lot with this project as my only prior GUI / UI designing
experience was with Java Swing.

The tutorial can be found here! : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFiEYuyTgL8

Other info: I finished the tutorial on the commit labelled "Finished Tutorial" if you would like to
see my implementation progress!
